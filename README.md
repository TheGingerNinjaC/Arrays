# Arrays

Write a program in C/C++ that receives a series of integer values from the user. The user nominates the number of values to be saved and then enters the values one at a time.

Then, prompt the user for the number of positions the array must shift. Any elements that falls off at the beginning of the array must be added to the rear of the array so that the number of elements in the array remains unchanged.
